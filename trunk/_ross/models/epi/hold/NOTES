Add infectivity to locations (based on ncontagious)

Lower infectivity rate dramatically (watch round-off)

Factor location populatiom into transition computation

R_t = number exposed / number infected_t-1 * D where D = average infection duration (3.5)

number of newly exposed for day t
number of total infected people on day t-1

have different R_0 by type
