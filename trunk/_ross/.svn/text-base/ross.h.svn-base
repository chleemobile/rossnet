    @section intro_sec Introduction
    
    ROSS is an acronym for Rensselaer's Optimistic Simulation System. It is a
    parallel discrete-event simulator that executes on shared-memory
    multiprocessor systems. ROSS is geared for running large-scale simulation
    models (i.e., 100K to even 1 million object models).  The synchronization
    mechanism is based on Time Warp. Time Warp is an optimistic
    synchronization mechanism develop by Jefferson and Sowizral [10, 11] used
    in the parallelization of discrete-event simulation. The distributed
    simulator consists of a collection of logical processes or LPs, each
    modeling a distinct component of the system being modeled, e.g., a server
    in a queuing network. LPs communicate by exchanging timestamped event
    messages, e.g., denoting the arrival of a new job at that server.

    The Time Warp mechanism uses a detection-and-recovery protocol to
    synchronize the computation. Any time an LP determines that it has
    processed events out of timestamp order, it "rolls back" those events, and
    re-executes them. For a detailed discussion of Time Warp as well as other
    parallel simulation protocols we refer the reader to [8]

    ROSS was modeled after a Time Warp simulator called GTW or Georgia Tech
    Time Warp[7]. ROSS helped to demonstrate that Time Warp simulators can be
    run efficiently both in terms of speed and memory usage relative to a
    high-performance sequential simulator.

    To achieve high parallel performance, ROSS uses a technique call Reverse
    Computation. Here, the roll back mechanism in the optimistic simulator is
    realized not by classic state-saving, but by literally allowing to the
    greatest possible extent events to be reverse. Thus, as models are
    developed for parallel execution, both the forward and reverse execution
    code must be written. Currently, both are done by hand. We are
    investigating automatic methods that are able to generate the reverse
    execution code using only the forward execution code as input. For more
    information on ROSS and Reverse Computation we refer the interested reader
    to [4, 5]. Both of these text are provided as additional reading in the
    ROSS distribution.
